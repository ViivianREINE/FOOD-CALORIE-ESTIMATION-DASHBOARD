A warm, **food image classification** with **calorie estimation**—like watching falling leaves, but for data and health.

</div>

---

##  Overview  
This repository houses a **Colab notebook** that uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to classify food items from images and estimate their calorie values. It also offers real-time interaction through a **Gradio interface**, complete with image preprocessing, model training, data augmentation, and visualization.:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
