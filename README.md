Project Title: Food Image Classification and Calorie Estimation (Colab Notebook)

Description:

This Colab notebook implements a deep learning-based project for food image classification and calorie prediction.

It uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify food items from images.

After classification, it estimates the calorie value based on the food category.

The project supports uploading images for real-time prediction and calorie output.

Features:

CNN model for food image classification.

Calorie mapping for each recognized food category.

Real-time image upload and prediction using Gradio.

Data preprocessing, augmentation, and visualization included.

Technologies Used:

Python

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy

OpenCV

Gradio (for interactive UI)

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualizations)

Usage:

Run all cells in Google Colab.

Upload a food image through the Gradio interface.

View the classified food name and estimated calorie value.

Check accuracy, loss curves, and prediction confidence.
